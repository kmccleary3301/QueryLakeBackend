# Unification Program Control

## Owner + Cadence
- Owner: QueryLake lead (designated by project lead)
- Cadence: weekly sync + monthly milestone review

## Escalation Path
- Auth provider strategy → QueryLake lead + security owner
- Umbrella scaling policy → infra owner + QueryLake lead
- Repo strategy / pin updates → release manager

## Release Gating Criteria (v1)
- All contract docs A–F published and implemented
- Umbrella scaling tested in staging (multi‑replica)
- Repo pins set and CI guardrail running
- API strategy stabilized with v2 shims
- Observability v1 dashboards live
